This R code helps to create three different heat maps. Firstly, It helps create the heat maps at the level of heat calculated in degrees centigrade from 2012 to 2022 at the district level. Secondly, it gives the code for change in the degrees of heat from the same month in the previous year and plots it within the district boundaries. For example, the change in heat from June 2020 to June 2021. Thirdly, it takes 2013 as the base year, as the heat in that year was observed to be more normally distributed than in other years, and finds the difference as compared to 2013, which essentially gives the heat change with respect to the temperature of 2013.
